# Physics is Observation

Physics is 100% observation, we can't make the sun shine, we can't make grass green. We can only try to find out why these things are so. 

Now lets say we are walking across a vast desert and we have never seen technology. Suddenly something shiny appears on the horizon. After many hours we approach it. It's a car, full of gas, with the keys inside. After pressing every possible button we find that turning the key to the right makes a loud noise and you can feel the vibration running through the car.

Immediately you know there must be a lion inside the trunk, because a lion is the only animal that can make such a sound. Then you notice after two days that it finally stops roaring, and you don't believe any lion can roar that long. Some of your group is still saying it must be a lion and it must have died. 

You figure out the mechanism to open the hood, and there's no lion. There's a complex assembly of wires, hoses, belts, cylinders. A skilled physicist will discover that fuel is injected, burns, and this produces movement, and eventually deduce the working of every part. 

A layman will conclude that there are miniature fuel-drinking lions in each cylinder that push and pull. To the layman this will make perfect sense. Of course the physicist will just smile and shake his head, because he actually took the time to observe the details rather than make quick conclusions that "make sense". 

The moral of the story is we can only observe, and not tell the universe how to be. One theory after another, getting closer and closer to reality.

# Economic Transition

The decline in traditional jobs and traditional economy presents a fantastic opportunity for us all. As we shift to a digital and robotic ecosystem, millions of new human minds will become available that were previously reserved for skill-based demands. In addition, all these minds will have unprecedented access to free or low-cost higher education. What if we can multiply the amount of scientific research done by 100 times or more? Research could become much cheaper as science becomes the next industry to become a massively parallel operation.

Instead of being intimidated by an impossibly ridiculous bleak future, let's make it through this growth period and emerge the victors that we are meant to be. If we don't do it, our children will. Why not start now?
